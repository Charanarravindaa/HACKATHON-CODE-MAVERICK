Each File is to run seperately like how we run code cell in kaggle. 
FOLLOW STEP BY STEP
1. RUN DATA_COLLECTION.PY TO GET PREPROCESSED DATA AND SPLIT DATA FOR TRAIN AND TEST
2. RUN TRAININGBERT.PY AND TRAININGGPT TO GET THEIR .PTH FILE PRE TRAINED MODELS
3. RUN ADVERSARIAL TRAINNING FOR NURTURING DATASETS
4. RUN NORMAL TESTING TO TEST THE MODELS TO SEE IF THEY IMPROVED.
